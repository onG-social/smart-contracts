### NFT Smart Contracts

NFT smart contracts are broken down via Network - blockchain - that they run on, and then further based on if they offer royalties (features) or not.

#### [Polygon](https://github.com/onG-social/smart-contracts/tree/master/NFT/Polygon)

Polygon Network is split up between 3 smart contract's.

##### [With Royalties](https://github.com/onG-social/smart-contracts/tree/master/NFT/Polygon/With%20Royalties)

Contracts with royalties offer a % back for every single secondary sale of the NFT to the content creator.

##### [Without Royalties](https://github.com/onG-social/smart-contracts/tree/master/NFT/Polygon/Without%20Royalties)

Wihtout royalties means you don't receive any % back as the content creator.

***SoMee Moments***
SoMee Momentsi is a special NFT marketplace used only for SoMee for important events and other art created by our resident artists.

***Polygon without Royalties***
This is a main network NFT marketplace that allows users to post/auction/sell with MATIC

#### [Ethereum](https://github.com/onG-social/smart-contracts/tree/master/NFT/Ethereum)

On Ethereum, we currently only offer the ETH + Royalties option using our $SOMEE token. This will alow minting and auctioning/selling with the $SOMEE token on the ETH network.

#### Binance
